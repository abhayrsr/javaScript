I have pushed some modules related to basic and advanced javaScript.

why node.js?
Node.js is a popular runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides several advantages and use cases that make it a valuable choice for various applications. Here are some reasons why you might consider using Node.js:

1. **JavaScript Everywhere**: Node.js allows you to use JavaScript on both the front end and the back end of web applications, providing a unified development experience. This enables developers to use the same language and share code between the client and server, reducing complexity and increasing efficiency.

2. **Asynchronous and Non-Blocking I/O**: Node.js utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it well-suited for handling concurrent requests and high traffic loads. It can efficiently handle many connections simultaneously without blocking the execution of other operations, resulting in improved performance and scalability.

3. **Vast Ecosystem and Package Manager**: Node.js has a large and active ecosystem with a wide range of open-source modules and packages available through the npm (Node Package Manager). This extensive package manager provides easy access to a plethora of tools, libraries, and frameworks, enabling developers to quickly build and extend their applications with existing solutions.

4. **Fast and Efficient**: Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which is known for its speed and efficiency. This enables Node.js applications to execute JavaScript code rapidly, making it suitable for real-time applications, streaming, and data-intensive tasks.

5. **Microservices and APIs**: Node.js is well-suited for developing microservices architectures and building scalable APIs. Its lightweight and modular nature allow for the creation of small, focused services that can be easily combined and orchestrated to form larger systems. Node.js, along with frameworks like Express.js, provides a robust foundation for building RESTful APIs.

6. **Community Support and Active Development**: Node.js has a thriving community of developers, which means there are abundant resources, tutorials, and forums available for learning and problem-solving. Additionally, Node.js is actively maintained by a dedicated team, ensuring regular updates, bug fixes, and security patches.

7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Node.js is designed to be cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. This versatility allows developers to write code once and deploy it across different environments, reducing development and maintenance efforts.

Overall, Node.js provides a powerful and flexible environment for building server-side applications, microservices, APIs, and real-time applications. Its combination of JavaScript, non-blocking I/O, extensive ecosystem, and community support make it a popular choice among developers for a wide range of use cases.
